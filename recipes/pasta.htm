<h2> Description </h2>
<p1>Usually based on wheat flour, pasta may or may not be dried and it is cooked by boiling in water or stock and served with a dressing and or other ingredients</p1>
<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul> 
    <li> All purpose flour </li>
    <li> Eggs </li>
    <li> olive oil </li>
    <li> Salt </li>
</ul>
<h3> Steps </h3>
<ol> 
    <li> First, make a nest with the flour on a clean work surface. Add the remaining ingredients to the center and use a fork to gently break up the eggs. Try to keep the flour walls intact as best as you can!</li>
    <li> Next, use your hands to gently mix in the flour. Continue working the dough to bring it together into a shaggy ball.</li>
    <li> Then, knead! At the beginning, the dough should feel pretty dry, but stick with it! It might not feel like itâ€™s going to come together, but after 8-10 minutes of kneading, it should become cohesive and smooth</li>
